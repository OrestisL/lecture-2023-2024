//create a nav mesh agent with an animator controller that changes animations depending on its status
//(moving, idle, running etc)
//use the camera prefab (in 3D Models/Misc folder) to locate the player
//when the camera sees the player, play a different animation (https://www.mixamo.com/#/ for animations)
//also stop nav mesh agent component
